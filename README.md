# DarknessToLight
Replication code and data for "Darkness to light: ethno-religious diversity and post-conflict reconstruction in post-ISIL Iraq" (Lloyd Lyall, 2019).
This is a test readme. 

The information on settlement-level ethno-religious composition used in this thesis is potentially sensitive. For this reason it is not publicly available, and I agreed to not present it in a way that can be used to identify the ethno-religious composition of individual settlements. As a result, the publicly available datasets and replication code include the ethno-religious diversity variable but do not include variables capturing the ethno-religious composition of individual settlements. Readers interested in replicating the analysis with the ethno-religious variables should first contact the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Iraq mission at iraqdtm@iom.int and request access to the Third Iraq Integrated Location Assessment (ILA III) with ethno-religious data. If IOM grants permission, I would be happy to share replication data that includes ethno-religious codings for individual settlements. 

Readers are referred to "Darkness to Light: ethno-religious diversity and post-conflict reconstruction in post-ISIL Iraq" for citations and credits.
