# Ethno-religious diversity and recovery after conflict in post-ISIL Iraq
Replication code and data for "Ethno-Religious Diversity and Recovery After Conflict in Post-ISIL Iraq: A Geospatial Approach" (Lloyd Lyall, 2019). The thesis is avaliable at https://purl.stanford.edu/qb151vz4409. Readers are referred to the thesis Works Cited section for citations and acknowledgements. 

The settlement-level IOM survey data on ethno-religious composition is potentially sensitive. For this reason it is not publicly available; I obtained written permission from IOM to use it. The parts of this dataset I use in this thesis could probably be considered public knowledge, but out of an abundance of caution, the publicly available dataset posted here excludes settlement-level ethno-religious composition information. The posted code replicates all the core empirical analysis of this thesis, but some results will be slightly different because the code excludes ethno-religious group dummies from the calculations. Users seeking to replicate specifications which include ethno-religious dummies should first obtain written permission from the IOM Iraq team to access the IOM ILA III dataset for Iraq with ethno-religious variables; I would then be happy to share the full dataset.
